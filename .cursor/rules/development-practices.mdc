# Development Practices

## Package Management

- Use **Yarn** as the package manager
- Keep dependencies updated and secure
- Use `yarn.lock` for reproducible builds
- Audit dependencies regularly for security vulnerabilities

## Code Quality

- Enforce consistent linting with ESLint
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Implement strict TypeScript configuration
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Maintain high code coverage standards

## Git Workflow

- Maintain a clear and clean git history
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Implement proper branching strategy
- Use pull requests for code reviews
- Follow conventional commit message format

## Environment Management

- Use environment variables via `.env.local`
- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Implement proper environment separation
- Use different configurations for development/staging/production

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Write type-safe code with strict TypeScript config
- Use proper type annotations and interfaces
- Implement generic types for reusable components
- Avoid `any` type usage - use proper type definitions
- Leverage TypeScript's type inference capabilities

## Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Use proper error logging and monitoring
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Handle both client-side and server-side errors
- Implement graceful degradation for error states

## Documentation

- Document complex business logic with comments
- Use JSDoc for public API functions
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document environment setup and deployment processes
- Keep API documentation current and accurate

## Security Practices

- Validate all user inputs on server side
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all production deployments
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
