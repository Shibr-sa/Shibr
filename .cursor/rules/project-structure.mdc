# Next.js Project Structure

## App Router Directory Structure

- Use the App Router directory structure under `app/`
- Place route-specific components in `app/` directory
- Place shared components in `components/` directory
- Place utilities and helpers in `lib/` directory
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)

## Component Organization

- Server Components go in `app/` for route-specific components
- Shared components belong in `components/` directory
- UI components from shadcn/ui go in `components/ui/`
- Context providers go in `contexts/` directory
- Custom hooks go in `hooks/` directory

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for directories: `admin-dashboard`, `brand-profile`
- Use camelCase for component files: `userProfile.tsx`, `productCard.tsx`
- Use descriptive names that indicate component purpose
- Group related components in subdirectories

## Import Organization

- Group imports by type: React, third-party libraries, internal modules
- Use absolute imports from workspace root
- Prefer named imports over default imports
- Keep import statements at the top of files
